    I do not understand why I seem able to make what people call art. For many long
     years I struggled to learn how to do it, and I don’t even know why I struggled.
     Then, in 1961, at the age of forty, it became clear to me that I was doing work
     I respected within my own strictest standards. Furthermore, I found this work
     respected by those whose understanding of art I valued. My first, instinctive
     reaction to this new situation was, if I’m an artist, being an artist isn’t so
     fancy because it’s just me. But now, thirteen years later, there seems to be more
      to it than that. It isn’t “just me.” A simplistic attitude toward the course of
      my life no longer serves.<br>
<br>
The “just me” reaction was, I think, an instinctive disavowal of the social role
of the artist. A life-saving disavowal. I refused, and still refuse, the inflated
definition of artists as special people with special prerogatives and special excuses.
If artists embrace this view of themselves, they necessarily have to attend to its
perpetuation. They have to live it out. Their time and energy are consumed for social
purposes. Artists then make decisions in terms of a role defined by others,
falling into their power and serving to illustrate their theories. The Renaissance
focused this social attention on the artist’s individuality, and the focus persists
today in a curious form that on the one hand inflates artists’ egoistic concept of
themselves and on the other places them at the mercy of the social forces on which
they become dependent. Artists can suffer terribly in this dilemma. It is taxing to
think out and then maintain a view of one’s self that is realistic.<br><br>
